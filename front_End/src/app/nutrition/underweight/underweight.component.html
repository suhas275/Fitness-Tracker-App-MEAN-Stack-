    <h1><b><u>Strategies for underweight Individuals:</u></b></h1>
    <h2>Increasing Calorie Intake:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For individuals classified as underweight, increasing calorie intake is crucial to support healthy weight gain.</li>
        <li>Consume a higher number of nutrient-dense foods throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Add calorie-rich foods like nuts, seeds, avocados, nut butter, and healthy oils to meals and snacks.</li>
        <li>Include complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, potatoes, and legumes for additional energy.</li>
        <li>Spread out calorie intake across several meals and snacks to ensure a steady supply of nutrients.</li>
        <li>Consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for appropriate calorie goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strength Training Exercises:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Engaging in strength training exercises is essential for underweight individuals to build lean muscle mass and promote healthy weight gain.</li>
        <li>Incorporate exercises such as weightlifting, resistance band workouts, bodyweight exercises, and using gym machines.</li>
        <li>Start with lighter weights and gradually progress to heavier ones as strength improves.</li>
        <li>Work with a certified personal trainer to design a safe and effective strength training program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Maintaining a Balanced Diet:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While the goal is to increase calorie intake, it is equally important to maintain a balanced diet for proper nutrition.</li>
        <li>Focus on consuming lean proteins such as poultry, fish, legumes, and dairy products to support muscle growth.</li>
        <li>Include a mix of complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for energy and essential nutrients.</li>
        <li>Incorporate healthy fats from sources like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil for additional calories.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated by consuming adequate fluids throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Consult with a registered dietitian to create a well-rounded meal plan that supports healthy weight gain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eating Enough</h2>
    <img width="600px" src="assets/underweight/underw-1.png" alt="Image Description">
    <ul>
        <li>Eat smaller meals, more frequently. Being underweight means you will have lower energy requirements and a smaller stomach, so you will become full faster. Planning on eating five or six slightly smaller—but complete—meals throughout the day can help you to get the nutrients you need more regularly, and to struggle less with finishing large portions at the beginning. And, as with any seemingly insurmountable task, breaking it into smaller parts can help to make it feel achievable.</li>
        <li>”Hara hachi bu” is a Confucian saying which means to eat only until you are eighty percent full. While usually thought of as a mantra for those trying to avoid overeating, it can be helpful for keeping the big picture in check: the point of this is to be healthy and well, not to keep eating to the point of being uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>You might already know that eating more frequently is also a tip given to those wanting to lose weight as well, to maintain the body's metabolism. So which is right? Both, actually! It just depends on what those frequent meals you're eating consist of. Slowing your metabolism can be attempted to gain weight, but it's not a healthy method that's generally advised.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Eat 250-500 extra calories each day.</h2>
    <p>This is a good baseline to maintain when you’re trying to pack on pounds. Searching online for a calorie calculator will yield multiple results, any of which you can use to determine how many calories are necessary to maintain your current weight. Then, add 250-500 to that number.</p>
    <img width="600px" src="assets/underweight/underw-2.png" alt="Image Description">
    <h2>Choose high-calorie, protein-dense foods.</h2>
    <p>Meats, cheeses, and nutritious whole-grain, complex carbohydrates are excellent choices. While simply eating a lot of nearly anything will make you gain weight, care must be taken to also answer the nutritional deficiencies that are part of being underweight.</p>
    <h3>Example breakfast dishes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scrambled eggs with cheese</li>
        <li>Yogurt with fruit and granola</li>
        <li>Breakfast burritos</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example lunch dishes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast sandwich with avocado</li>
        <li>Tuna salad</li>
        <li>Whole wheat bagels with cream cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example dinner dishes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak with cooked vegetables</li>
        <li>Baked potatoes with butter and sour cream</li>
        <li>Grilled salmon with rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exercising Right</h2>
    <img width="600px" src="assets/underweight/underw-3.png" alt="Image Description">
    <h3>Lift weights.</h3>
    <p>Strength training is an important avenue for gaining weight and staying healthy. Increasing your food intake and building muscle at the gym is an effective two-pronged approach.</p>
    <p>If you want to put on weight, opt for fewer repetitions with more weight instead of the opposite. Each exercise is different, but 10-12 reps is considered a normal amount for a majority: shoot for 6-8 in these instances instead.</p>
    <p>While lifting weights is focused on building muscle, it isn’t only for bodybuilders. Nothing about lifting weights says you will necessarily become “bulky,” if you fear your body becoming too big after gaining weight.</p>

    <h3>Refuel your body diligently.</h3>
    <p>Exercising will burn energy as you’re putting it into your body, but it can also stimulate your appetite. This will help you to establish and solidify better, more regular eating habits as you respond to the energy needs of your body.</p>
    <p>Particular care should be taken to make sure you’re getting the requisite protein for rebuilding your muscle after a day at the gym. Meats, eggs, and cheese are effective here, as are nutritional supplements and shakes made especially for post-workout intake.</p>

    <h3>Stay healthy.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sickness will stop your weight gain plan in its tracks, so it’s important to still eat a healthy diet (even if you’re eating a lot more of that diet) and to get plenty of rest and exercise.</li>
        <li>Being underweight can lead to a weaker immune system, so this will require particular diligence on your part.</li>
        <li>Anemia, caused by iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiencies, can occur among the underweight. Supplement your diet with these nutrients if you feel dizzy, fatigued, or headache-y.</li>
        <li>Sudden or substantial weight loss can also be indicative of disease. The issue could be digestive, thyroid-related, diabetes, or even cancer. Only a medical professional can determine this, so schedule a consultation if experiencing any unusual weight loss.</li>
    </ul>
